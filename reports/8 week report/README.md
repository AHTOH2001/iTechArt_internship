# Eighth week report

### Tuesday 31.08

- Suddenly vacation has been ended up and token authentication is not waiting, so I spent most of the time on
  implementing JWT in frontend, in particular send requests with csrf and access token and also refresh access token
  when it is needed. But before this I spent for about one hour on fixing problem with the git branch that I had made
  before vacation (9 hours)
