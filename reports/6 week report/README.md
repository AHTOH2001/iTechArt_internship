# Sixth week report

### Monday 16.08

- That day I entirely spent on Udemy course. Theme was "The firebase". Because React course is aimed at the frontend,
  they preferred to use ready to use backend rather than write it on their own. And for me that was interesting to know
  something absolutely new. (5 hours)

### Tuesday 17.08

- That day was the meeting day, because the meeting with mentor was longer than two hours. But by the way I managed to
  ended up implementation of registration and authorization in Udemy project. Also I started the redux topic in
  course. (5 hours)
