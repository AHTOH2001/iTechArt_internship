# Sixth week report

### Monday 16.08

- That day I entirely spent on Udemy course. Theme was "The firebase". Because React course is aimed at the frontend,
  they preferred to use ready to use backend rather than write it on their own. And for me that was interesting to know
  something absolutely new. (5 hours)

### Tuesday 17.08

- That day was the meeting day, because the meeting with mentor was longer than two hours. But by the way I managed to
  ended up implementation of registration and authorization in Udemy project. Also I started the redux topic in
  course. (5 hours)

### Wednesday 18.08

- Started preparation for the project: created repositories (one for the backend and one for the frontend), created
  branches for git flow and opened first pull request with preparations such as installing linter, react and other
  necessary packages. Moreover, spent some time on the udemy course. (7 hours)

### Thursday 19.08

- Ended up preparation of repositories and closed two pull requests: one is yesterday's about preparations, and the
  other one is about Json Web Token implementation (actually the last one is not absolutely closed, but very close to
  the closing :) ). And in udemy course I started the redux theme. (7 hours)

### Friday 20.08

- Started working with the frontend side of the project. By the way I decided to name project "FrontieBontie", I hope
  mentor would not mind üòù. Anyway, that day I whole day tried to implement log in mechanism, still not done, but some
  progress had already been done. And in particular created simple log in page, throught which request can be sent to
  the backend (7 hours)
