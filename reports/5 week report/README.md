# Fifth week report

### Monday 09.08

- That day I have done four more trello cards. The hardest one was the card about jQuery, not because of the complexity
  but because of the size. The remaining three cards were more simple, so simple that I managed to put them into "done"
  section without discussing. (5 hours)

###### P.S. As you can see a revolution happened in report writing. The problem is that I don't know how to rephrase what I had written, but it is a problem of future me :)

### Tuesday 10.08

- Eventually started React trello cards and somehow managed to done seven cards (4 hours). This time I don't sure which
  of the cards were the hardest one, but I guess JSX one, however with not big margin. Also, I continued passing React
  udemy course and for about half of time I spent to remind what I already knew (2 hours). In total six hours were
  worked.

### Wednesday 11.08

- And another internship day was passed. That day was not so profitable in a sence of cards amount, because only two
  cards were done. But this time these cards were pretty massive, so I guess I did well. And as last day I spent some
  time on Udemy course. (6 hours)
