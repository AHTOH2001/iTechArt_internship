# Fifth week report

### Monday 09.08

- That day I have done another four trello cards. The hardest one was the card about jQuery, not because complexity but
  because size. The rest three card was more simple, that simple that I managed to put them into "done" section without
  discussing.

###### P.S. As you can see a revolutionary happened in report writing. The problem is that I don't know how to rephrase what I had written, but it is a problem of future me :)
