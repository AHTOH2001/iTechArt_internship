# Fifth week report

### Monday 09.08

- That day I have done four more trello cards. The hardest one was the card about jQuery, not because of the complexity
  but because of the size. The remaining three cards were more simple, so simple that I managed to put them into "done"
  section without discussing. (5 hours)

###### P.S. As you can see a revolution happened in report writing. The problem is that I don't know how to rephrase what I had written, but it is a problem of future me :)

### Tuesday 10.08

- I eventually started React trello cards and somehow managed to do seven cards (4 hours). This time I not sure which of
  the cards was the hardest one, but I guess JSX one, however with not big margin. Also, I continued passing React udemy
  course and for about half of time I spent to remind what I already knew (2 hours). In total six hours were worked. (6
  hours)

### Wednesday 11.08

- And another internship day was passed. That day was not so profitable in a sence of cards amount, because only two
  cards were done. But this time these cards were pretty massive, so I guess I did well. And as the previous day I spent
  some time on Udemy course. (6 hours)

### Thursday 12.08

- That day was the rest day, because I let myself to work only four hours in total. And even without udemy course I have
  done only two cards. (4 hours)

###### P.S. The project is comming... So I hope it will bring variety in my reports.

### Friday 13.08

- Suddenly all cards are in the "to discuss" or in the "done" areas. Except those which are forbidden to pass. And spent
  the rest of the time on Udemy course. (6 hours)
