# Seventh week report

### Monday 23.08

- Spent one hour on the redux theme in udemy course (1 hour)
- The rest six hours I spent on implementing authorization via JWT in the frontend. In particular I have done
  implementing validations of form, especially hard for me was to make the submit button disabled when any fields are
  not valid yet (maybe because of my inexperiences of ant design). Also, I stored tokens in redux store, but it turned
  out that redux store is reinitializes every time when a page is reloaded. (6 hours)
