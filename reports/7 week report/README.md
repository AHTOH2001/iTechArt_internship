# Seventh week report

### Monday 23.08

- Spent an hour on the redux theme in udemy course (1 hour)
- The rest six hours I spent on implementing authorization via JWT in the frontend. In particular on implementing
  validations of form, especially hard for me was to make the submit button disabled when any fields are not valid yet (
  maybe because of my inexperiences of ant design). Also, I stored tokens in redux store, but it turned out that redux
  store is reinitializes every time when a page is reloaded. (6 hours)

### Tuesday 24.08

- That day I got stucked on http only cookies to store JWT on frontend safely. And I hoped that I would finish this task
  next day (4 hours)
- In addition, spent about an hour on the Udemy course. (1 hour)

### Wednesday 25.08

- That was the day before small vacation, so I decided to work as much as I can and worked out nine hours on web token
  authentication. I believe that on backend side it is approximately done, but frontend side still need some
  improvement (9 hours)
